The goal of aracari is to …

Access the
[paper](https://javirudolph.github.io/aracari/paper/paper.html), and
[appendixA](https://javirudolph.github.io/aracari/appendixA/appendixA.html), [appendixB](https://javirudolph.github.io/aracari/appendixB/appendixB.html)

-----

## Installation

You can install the released version of aracari from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("aracari")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("javirudolph/aracari")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(aracari)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
summary(cars)
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub\!
