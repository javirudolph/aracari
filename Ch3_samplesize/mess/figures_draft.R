## Ch3 figures ##

# Figure 1 -----
# Describe the different scenarios
# I vote for four plus the example with the Russo dispersal kernel

# Maybe this is actually a graphic showing each scenario as the change in variance and the mean.


# Figure 2 -----
# Describe the "real" data? The histograms for the 50k samples and the density curve associated to that.


# Figure 3 ----
# The bias of the estimator, for each threshold and across sample size for all scenarios


# Figure 4 ----
# Bias corrected estimator compared to the uncorrected one
# Does the variance decrease? Does sample size have an effect?


# Figure 5 -----
# Full process for the russso kernel as the example in "real" life
