# Introduction

## What is dispersal?

## What is the difference with movement?

## What is the role of individual variation in dispersal and movement?

## How can we explore the role and importance of this variation?

## What statistical tools can we leverage to understand and predict the role of individual variation in dispersal and how does this extend to populations and ecosystems?

## The importance of characterizing dispersal in metapopulation models
